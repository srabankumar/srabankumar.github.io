Hi Folks,


In javascript world, React js is the recent hot topic because of it's the way of handling DOM(Document Object Model) which makes it superfast.
Interaction with DOM always cost time which eventually makes DOM slower . React uses virtual DOM instead of real DOM so we need to interact with virtual DOM instead of real one then it will update the real DOM.
    
 What is really happening in the Background of Reactjs Application ?
        Interaction with real DOM is slower while interaction with javascript object is fast. So in React we always interact with a javascript Object and makes all necessary changes .Then React renders this object in DOM .
        
 So let's explore React
 
  Before wrting code in react we need to include react and react-dom library .You can find those from [Here](https://github.com/facebook/react/releases)
