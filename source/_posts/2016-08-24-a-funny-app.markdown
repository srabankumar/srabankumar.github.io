Hello folks,

After making of two games ,I have completely fallen in love with canvas and javascript .So i had decided to make another game by using this.This time i thought to make a funny simple game. So i have decided to make a game name as “KNOW YOUR STRENGTH” .Actually In this game a button is attached with a meter containing a ball inside it. You have to hit that button with a hammer .As u hit that button ,the ball inside the meter grows up.The meter is divided into 4 part named as “WEAK”,”AVERAGE”,”STRONG”,”SUPER STRONG”.The ball inside the meter stops in a definite part and according to that part the meter gives your strength. So simple game.
