Hi Viewers,

Before going to describe about the second version of my game let me describe a small intro about my first game. Actually my first game is a small helicopter game in which u have to overcome various obstacles to reach the destination to win it (Not a great game at all).When i started learning javascript and jquery ,then i decided to create that game .It is just simple game without canvas.

some drawbacks of my first game:

1)Obstacles are static

2)no level (means difficulty level)

3)No score and many more

To Avoid such drawbacks ,i started learning HTML canvas and more on javascript so that i can rectify my errors in the next game.Then I created the second version of that game by using canvas to make it a beautiful one. Then after working for 2 days ,i successfully created the second version of that game by adding some more features in it.Those are:

1)moving objects(obstacles)

2)Three Difficulty level(easy,medium and hard)

3)Score board

4)more attractive background than previous one

5)Reset Button to play again..
