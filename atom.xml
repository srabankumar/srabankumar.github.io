    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p> Apart from some technical stuff ,now i want to share something else that is &ldquo;How i dive into python world&rdquo;. Actually before entering to college,i know python is something that we hear from our childhood.I was only stick with &ldquo;C&rdquo; and &ldquo;C++&rdquo;. I heard about &ldquo;PYTHON&rdquo; from one of my friend. Then in curiosity,I started learning it and soon i find it is more easier and flexible than other programming languages.The most important feature of python which attracts me most is it is open-source.Soon i fell love with it and i started writing programs with it and i love to do that.I started learning it from various sources like python docs which is available in python.org website,video tutorial from the &ldquo;NEW BOSTON&rdquo;,and books like think python,byte of python and many more.. Web-development is also easy with it by it&rsquo;s &ldquo;DJANGO&rdquo; framework and &ldquo;pygame&rdquo; helps users to creates interactive games. There are many python user group almost in every countries and cities around the world . They also organize some event almost in every year in which they discuss about various stuffs,talks and organize some workshop based upon python.India also organize &ldquo;PYCOON INDIA&#8221;in which the python users join and share their knowledge and i think it is the beauty of to be a part of the open-source family . Afterall,I feel lucky to be a part of this family.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks,</p>

<p>After making of two games ,I have completely fallen in love with canvas and javascript .So i had decided to make another game by using this.This time i thought to make a funny simple game. So i have decided to make a game name as “KNOW YOUR STRENGTH” .Actually In this game a button is attached with a meter containing a ball inside it. You have to hit that button with a hammer .As u hit that button ,the ball inside the meter grows up.The meter is divided into 4 part named as “WEAK”,”AVERAGE”,”STRONG”,”SUPER STRONG”.The ball inside the meter stops in a definite part and according to that part the meter gives your strength. So simple game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi Viewers,</p>

<p>Before going to describe about the second version of my game let me describe a small intro about my first game. Actually my first game is a small helicopter game in which u have to overcome various obstacles to reach the destination to win it (Not a great game at all).When i started learning javascript and jquery ,then i decided to create that game .It is just simple game without canvas.</p>

<p>some drawbacks of my first game:</p>

<p>1)Obstacles are static</p>

<p>2)no level (means difficulty level)</p>

<p>3)No score and many more</p>

<p>To Avoid such drawbacks ,i started learning HTML canvas and more on javascript so that i can rectify my errors in the next game.Then I created the second version of that game by using canvas to make it a beautiful one. Then after working for 2 days ,i successfully created the second version of that game by adding some more features in it.Those are:</p>

<p>1)moving objects(obstacles)</p>

<p>2)Three Difficulty level(easy,medium and hard)</p>

<p>3)Score board</p>

<p>4)more attractive background than previous one</p>

<p>5)Reset Button to play again..</p>
